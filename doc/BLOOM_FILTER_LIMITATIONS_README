------ BLOOM FILTER LIMITATIONS --------

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
1) supports only equality statements
2) speed can be improved by factorizing hashing across multiple individual bloom filter within the multi-bloom filter
3) false positive can be reduce implementing a full featured Bloomier Filter instead of the multi-bloom we have at the moment.
